## Project Summary

- In this Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) project, the iris data set will be utilized. This particular data set is widely known and contains information about iris species along with measurements of sepal and petal. The necessary data for this EDA is stored in a file named iris_data.csv and can be found in the data directory.

### Objective 1:

- Determine the number of data points (rows)
- Determine the column names
- Determine the data types for each column

### Objective 2:

- Examine the species names noting that they all begin with 'Iris-' and then removing the 'Iris' portion of the name so the species name is shorter.

### Objective 3:

- Determine the number of each species present.
- Determine the mean, median, and quantiles and ranges (max-min) for each petal and sepal measurement.

### Objective 4:

- For each species calaculate the mean of each measurement (sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width).
- For each species calaculate the median of each of these measurements.

### Objective 5:

- Make a scatter plot of sepal_length vs sepal_width using Matplotlib. Label the axes and give the plot a title.

### Objective 6:

- Make a histogram of any one of the four features. Label axes and title it as appropriate.

### Objective 7:

- Create a single plot with histograms for each feature (petal_width, petal_length, sepal_width, sepal_length) overlayed. Aslo create four individual histogram plots in a single figure, where each plot contains one feature.

### Objective 8:

- Using Pandas, make a boxplot of each petal and sepal measurement.

### Objective 9:

- Make a single boxplot where the features are separated in the x-axis and species are colored with different hues.

### Objective 10:

- Make a pairplot with Seaborn to examine the correlation between each of the measurements.
